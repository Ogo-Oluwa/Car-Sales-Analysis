## Project Overview:
>> This project analyzes a car sales dataset from a U.S.-based company to uncover valuable insights into sales performance and market behavior. The work involves cleaning and preparing the data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and creating visualizations to highlight key factors such as pricing trends, brand competitiveness, and customer purchasing patterns. Using pivot tables, the analysis further explores metrics like total sales by transmission type and gender, regional and gender distributions, as well as sales by color and gender revenue, providing a deeper understanding of the main factors driving car sales.
